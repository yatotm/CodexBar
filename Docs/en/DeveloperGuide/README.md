## Core Terminology

| Term | Precise meaning in this project |
| --- | --- |
| snapshot | Repeatable current state; it does not imply that an event just occurred |
| transition | A one-time state change from trusted live input that may drive side effects such as notifications |
| bootstrap | Restoring an in-memory baseline from existing local data without replaying historical side effects |
| stale | An old value is available for display, but the source could not confirm it in the current cycle |
| unavailable | No trusted source is currently available; this is not equivalent to empty or `0` |
| generation | The generation of a data source or asynchronous operation, used to reject late results |
| source generation | The source identity of a day's raw Hook file; distinct from a code schema |
| owned | CodexBar has persisted responsibility for restoring system sleep |
| external | A source outside CodexBar had already set the system state |
