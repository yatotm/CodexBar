# Live Task Monitoring

[简体中文](../../DeveloperGuide/activity-monitor.md) | English

## Goals

The live-task flow answers four questions:

- Is a task currently running?
- Is a task waiting for user approval?
- Did a recent task complete or terminate?
- Which running tasks have made no progress for too long?

Hook events provide low-latency signals, and rollout files provide authoritative lifecycle context. [`CodexActivityMonitor.swift`](../../../CodexBar/Services/Workflow/CodexActivityMonitor.swift) merges both into the sole task snapshot:

```text
Hook JSONL -> HookEventTailReader ---------+
                                          +-> CodexActivityMonitor -> CodexActivitySnapshot
rollout JSONL -> CodexSessionLifecycleReader+
```

### Division Between Sources

| Information | Primary source | Supplemental source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Live prompt, tool, compact, and subagent progress | Hook | Rollout progress |
| User-approval candidate | `PermissionRequest` | Rollout reviewer confirmation |
| Turn start | `UserPromptSubmit` | Rollout `startedAt` or historical lookup |
| Completion candidate | `Stop` | Rollout terminal |
| Completion versus termination | Rollout terminal | Grace-expiration fallback |
| Effort | Hook-recorder lookup | Rollout lifecycle backfill |

Hook prioritizes low latency; rollout prioritizes semantic accuracy. They do not simply overwrite by timestamp. Every field has its own trusted source.

### Snapshots and Transitions

A snapshot may be read repeatedly after view reconstruction, a new subscription, or a settings change. A transition may be emitted once from live data only.

For example, bootstrap may recover a task already waiting for approval when the app starts:

- The snapshot should show it waiting
- No waiting transition should be emitted
- The notification service therefore does not replay a historical alert

Completion works the same way. Notifications consume `.completed` transitions rather than scanning `recentCompletions`, preventing reminders on app restart or UI refresh.

## HookEventTailReader

[`HookEventTailReader.swift`](../../../CodexBar/Services/Workflow/HookEventTailReader.swift) is an actor that checks Hook event files every 2 seconds by default.

### Bootstrap

Initial startup reads the latest 24 hours to establish a task baseline:

- Read chunks of at most 512 KB
- Try at most 3 times to obtain stable file boundaries
- Use inode and size to detect replacement or append during reading
- Never trigger historical completion or waiting notifications from bootstrap results

If it cannot obtain a stable boundary, the reader moves to the current file tail and publishes explicit unhealthy state. Incomplete history is not misrepresented as a real task change.

### Bootstrap Is One Logical Transaction

The 24-hour window may span two calendar-day files, and one file may arrive in several 512 KB batches.

At `.bootstrapStart`, the monitor clears previous recovered state and pauses side effects. It consumes every `.bootstrapEvents` batch, then waits until `.bootstrapEnd` to:

- Fill in lifecycle from rollout
- Apply persisted Activity Protection records
- Reconcile silence under the current threshold
- Look up missing prompt starts selectively
- Publish one complete snapshot

Neither UI nor notifications should observe a partially recovered intermediate batch.

### Stable-Boundary Retries

At the start of an attempt, the reader fixes inode and size for all relevant date files and validates them again after reading to those bounds:

- A historical date must retain both inode and size
- The current date may append only beyond the fixed upper bound
- The calendar day must not cross midnight during the read

If any condition fails, the reader retries from a new baseline. After three consecutive failures, it moves to the current tail and publishes degraded health, pausing Activity Protection checks.

### Complete-Line Cursor

The Hook recorder may be writing the final line. The reader includes only bytes before the last newline in `completeOffset`.

A partial line is neither discarded nor classified as corrupt. The next cycle rereads from the old offset and commits after the line is complete.

### Date Rollover and File Replacement

Normal rollover drains the old date file before switching to the new date. An inode change or file shrink restarts bootstrap instead of reusing the old cursor.

When `UserPromptSubmit` predates the current incremental window, the reader can look backward up to 8 MB to recover the prompt start of an existing task.

### `drainNow()` Read Barrier

Every caller of `drainNow()` must wait for a read that begins after its request:

```text
Call drainNow
  -> Record request generation
  -> Wait for the next new read to begin
  -> Wait for that read to finish
  -> Return that read's result
```

A read already in progress before the call cannot satisfy the barrier. If the reader is replaced, the data source is unavailable, or the task is canceled, the caller must not continue evaluating from an old snapshot.

### Exact Generational Semantics of the Barrier

Each `drainNow()` increments `requestedDrainGeneration` and registers its own waiter.

If a read is in flight, the request sets only `hasPendingDrain`. After the current cycle completes, the reader must begin another cycle that captures this request generation.

One read can satisfy several waiters queued before it begins, but not a waiter added afterward. This is the happens-after guarantee required for wake recovery.

Actors can reenter during `await`; `isProcessingReads` and `hasPendingDrain` converge all external requests into one serial drain loop so two reads never advance offset concurrently.

## Rollout Lifecycle Reading

[`CodexSessionLifecycleReader.swift`](../../../CodexBar/Services/Workflow/CodexSessionLifecycleReader.swift) reads `$CODEX_HOME/sessions` and `$CODEX_HOME/archived_sessions`.

Rules are:

- Poll every 1 second by default
- Begin with a 512 KB tail window
- Look back at most 8 MB for turn-context fields such as effort
- Parse only lifecycle, turn, progress, effort, and reviewer
- Never read or store conversation content for product presentation

Hook `Stop` is only a completion candidate. Rollout terminal state distinguishes actual completion, user cancellation, and abnormal termination.

### Locating Session Files

The reader checks a few likely directories first:

1. `sessions/YYYY/MM/DD` for the task start date
2. The current date directory
3. `archived_sessions`

A resume can continue a session created long ago. If the fast path misses, each active session lifecycle performs one recursive fallback scan at most, avoiding a full sessions-tree traversal every second.

If a file moves to the archive, a missing cached URL clears its cursor and allows full discovery again.

### Rollout Read Budget

Live tasks need lifecycle near an active turn, not a full read of a long-running session. Starting from the last 512 KB reduces resident I/O and discards the first potentially partial line.

If effort remains missing, a targeted lookup for that turn can read up to 8 MB.

Effort backfill applies only to nonterminal tasks that have run for at least 2 seconds and still lack effort, with a 10-second retry interval per turn. This avoids a large search immediately after every task creation.

### Rollout Fields

The shared `CodexRolloutLineEnvelope` extracts only fields needed for turn context, lifecycle, and progress. Prompt, response, and tool content never enters the activity model.

This tightens privacy boundaries and reduces decode cost for large rollouts. A new live field should extend the minimal envelope rather than decode the full transcript into a general JSON tree.

## Task Identity

The task key chooses the most precise available identity:

1. `session ID + turn ID`
2. `session ID`
3. Anonymous project key

A new prompt replaces the old turn in the same session. The old turn enters terminal grace for up to 5 seconds so late ending events can reconcile it.

Subagent events update activity under their parent task and do not create separate top-level cards.

### Identity Precision and Fallback

`session ID + turn ID` precisely distinguishes sequential turns in one session and is preferred.

Some events contain only session ID. A session key still participates in state, but terminal matching must be more conservative. If one session has several candidates, the monitor returns ambiguous rather than guessing which task ended.

Without a session ID, only a project key remains. It may merge concurrent anonymous tasks in one project, so anonymous tasks provide reversible UI visibility but cannot drive notifications, sleep prevention, or persisted protection.

### Auto-review Origin Filtering

`CodexActivityMonitor.apply` checks `WorkflowHookEvent.origin` before any state transition. At construction and decoding boundaries, `WorkflowHookEvent` prefers an explicit origin and uses an exact `model == "codex-auto-review"` match as the `.autoReview` fallback only when that origin is `unknown`. An `autoReview` event never enters the live-task state machine, so it cannot appear in the menu bar, activity card, Task Center, or task counts and cannot produce notifications, haptics, approval waiting, Stalled Task Protection, or sleep-prevention contribution.

Filtering uses the exact `session ID + turn ID` because Codex subagent Hooks reuse the parent session ID. Filtering by session alone would also hide the real main task.

When an exact Auto-review event arrives, the monitor:

- Removes the active task and terminal-grace candidate for that key
- Removes recent completion, recent termination, and terminal-deduplication memory for that key
- Cancels Stalled Task Protection attempts, persisted records, and pending notifications
- Remembers the exact key in a 24-hour bounded table so later `unknown` events cannot revive the same task

If an explicit `main` or `auxiliary` event later matches the same key, source truth wins and clears that ignored-key inference. An Auto-review event without a turn ID is ignored only for that event and never creates a session-wide blacklist.

Other subagents, including Memories, are classified as `auxiliary` and participate in auxiliary-task association. Raw Hook events still enter historical aggregation; live Auto-review filtering does not change statistics or CloudKit data.

A missing or unrecognized JSONL `origin` first decodes as `unknown`. An exact `codex-auto-review` model match normalizes it to `.autoReview`; other records remain `.unknown`. This step uses existing record fields, performs no additional historical rollout scan for origin classification, and does not rewrite raw Hook records.

### New Prompts and Terminal Grace

Turns in one session run sequentially. When a new prompt arrives, the old turn must leave the active list immediately or the UI briefly shows two top-level tasks.

The new prompt may precede the old turn's rollout terminal, however. Recording termination immediately would misclassify a normally completed task.

The old turn therefore moves to `pendingTerminalTasks`:

- Remove it from the active snapshot immediately
- Retain task metadata and start time
- Wait up to 5 seconds for rollout terminal
- Classify accurately as completed or aborted when terminal arrives
- Converge with a conservative fallback when grace expires without terminal

`SessionEnd` uses the same confirmation window but moves all tasks in the session no later than that event.

### Rejecting Late Events

Tasks store `lastActivityAt`, and terminal memory stores completion or termination time:

- An event older than current last activity cannot overwrite newer state
- A new prompt no later than a remembered terminal cannot revive the old task
- A `Stop` matching several candidates is not guessed
- A key already in terminal deduplication memory clears recovery tasks left by abnormal ordering

These comparisons use event time rather than batch-arrival order because cross-process file writes and rollout polling can deliver old events late.

### Anonymous Tasks

When `WorkflowHookEvent.sessionId` is missing, the key is an anonymous project key. `isAnonymous` propagates through `CodexActivityTaskSnapshot`, `CodexActivityCompletion`, and `CodexActivityTermination`.

Anonymous tasks remain in activity snapshots and recent terminal records. The activity card and Task Center use the orange `person.crop.circle.dashed` icon with help text `Anonymous tasks do not prevent sleep`. The card's `+N` counts all other active tasks only.

Anonymous running tasks do not show precise elapsed time, and anonymous completion and termination records omit precise duration.

They publish no waiting or completion transitions to notification consumers, trigger no task haptics, enter neither the running nor waiting sets for KeepAlive, and do not participate in Stalled Task Protection. `activityProtectionIdentifier` returns `nil` for an anonymous key, so protection state never persists an anonymous task.

## State Machine

Active tasks mainly use these internal states:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `running` | Codex is processing the current turn |
| `waitingApproval` | The current turn is explicitly waiting for user approval |
| `suppressed` | Stalled Task Protection hid the task pending new progress |

`PermissionRequest` enters `waitingApproval` only when the reviewer is the user. Automatic or policy approval does not count as user waiting.

Terminal signals reconcile by reliability:

- `SessionEnd` ends the session
- Rollout terminal distinguishes completion from termination
- `Stop` creates a completion candidate without stronger evidence
- A new prompt may end the display lifecycle of the old turn

### Main Event-to-State Transitions

| Current state | Input | New state | Additional action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Absent | `UserPromptSubmit` | running | Save trusted `startedAt` |
| Absent | Top-level tool or compact | running | Recover task with unknown `startedAt` |
| running | Tool, compact, or subagent progress | running | Update last progress and generation |
| running | `PermissionRequest` + reviewer user | waitingApproval | Publish live waiting transition |
| waitingApproval | New progress | running | Clear pending approval and protection record |
| running or waiting | `Stop` | terminal candidate | Retain completion or wait for rollout reconciliation |
| active | New prompt or `SessionEnd` | pending terminal | Remove from snapshot and begin 5-second grace |
| running | Silence exceeds threshold | suppressed | Hide and remove sleep-prevention contribution |
| suppressed | New progress | running | Clear persisted protection and old notification |

### Two-Stage Approval Confirmation

`PermissionRequest` indicates an approval flow, but reviewer may be user, policy, or automatic review.

If the Hook event includes reviewer, the task can confirm immediately. If reviewer is missing, it saves `pendingApprovalRequestedAt` and waits for rollout polling to fill it in.

Only an explicit user reviewer emits a waiting transition. Remaining running while uncertain is more truthful than falsely telling the user Codex is waiting for them.

### Effort Merging

Several context events in one turn may report different reasoning efforts. The task does not silently let the last overwrite the first. It marks `mixed` after observing conflict.

### Subagent Count Reliability

A subagent turn ID belongs to the subagent, so its parent can be associated only by shared session.

Active subagent count is reliable only when exactly one active parent exists in that session, no pending-terminal ambiguity exists, and start/stop events carry stable agent IDs.

With missing IDs, stop-before-start, or several candidates in one session, the monitor lowers reliability and the UI omits a falsely precise number.

## Snapshot Priority

When several tasks and temporary states coexist, the outward snapshot uses this priority:

```text
Waiting for approval > Running > Recently completed > Recently terminated > Idle
```

Completion remains green in the menu bar for 30 seconds. Task Center retains recent tasks for 10 minutes, while terminal deduplication memory lasts 24 hours.

The snapshot feeds:

- Menu bar status dot
- Main-panel task card
- Task Center
- Notification system
- Sleep-prevention controller

### Snapshot Publication

The monitor polls rollout each second and also updates itself at several deadlines. Assigning the same value to `@Published` on every cycle would make SwiftUI and all Combine consumers recalculate unnecessarily.

A candidate snapshot is compared with the current value and published only after structural change. Views format elapsed time from the current clock and do not require per-second mutation of task objects.

### Stable Ordering

Several tasks in one batch can share a timestamp; comparing timestamps alone does not determine their relative order.

All lists sort by most recent time first and then display UUID string. Stable order keeps SwiftUI diffing from jumping when equivalent tasks randomly exchange positions.

### Cleanup Uses the Nearest Deadline

The monitor manages completion highlight, terminal grace, activity retention, history retention, terminal deduplication, and protection-record expiration.

It does not scan everything on a fixed high-frequency timer. It gathers future deadlines and schedules one `Task` for the nearest. After it fires, it recalculates the next.

This reduces meaningless wakeups for a resident menu bar app and lets every retention period take effect on time even without a new Hook event.

## System Sleep and Wake

Stalled Task Protection pauses when the system is about to sleep. Wake follows a strict recovery order:

1. Enter recovery and keep protection paused
2. Wait for `HookEventTailReader.drainNow()` to succeed
3. Reset rollout-lifecycle parsing fallback
4. Reconcile from the new Hook and rollout results together
5. Resume Stalled Task Protection

If the new read fails, the reader is replaced, or the source is unavailable, evaluation must not continue from the pre-sleep snapshot.

### Evaluation Pauses During System Sleep

Silence evaluation stops during system sleep. On recovery, the monitor silently reconciles progress from newly read Hook and rollout data before resuming normal evaluation.

The check task waits with `SuspendingClock`, but silence duration is calculated from `Date` and `lastProgressAt` without subtracting time spent asleep. `will-sleep` enters recovery; `did-wake` reevaluates after a new data read barrier.

### Why Wake Order Cannot Be Reversed

Rollout reconciliation must occur after a successful Hook drain.

Reading rollout first may find lifecycle data whose task key has not yet been added to the monitor from Hook events written during sleep. Resuming protection first could hide tasks from a pre-sleep last-progress time.

`readerGeneration` prevents a returning wake task from using a reader replaced by a Hook settings change. `recoveryGeneration` prevents an older recovery from unpausing evaluation after two overlapping sleep or settings changes.

## Stalled Task Protection

Stalled Task Protection works only while Prevent System Sleep is enabled and evaluates only non-anonymous `running` tasks.

Tasks waiting for approval are excluded because waiting is a legitimate no-progress state.

Threshold options are:

- 30 minutes
- 1 hour, the default
- 2 hours
- 4 hours

At the threshold:

1. Update the in-memory protection record and enqueue its serial persistence
2. Start notification submission and a 3-second grace period together
3. Revalidate the candidate after notification completes or grace expires
4. If still valid, hide it from the activity snapshot
5. If new progress appears during or after this process, clear protection and restore display

Hiding does not depend on notification success. The 3 seconds is only the maximum wait for an explanatory notification; sleep-prevention contribution is still released afterward.

Evaluation pauses during:

- Hook bootstrap
- System sleep
- Wake recovery
- Hook data-source unavailability
- Reader replacement

### Purpose of Progress Generation

Timestamps alone cannot protect an asynchronous attempt. Two progress events may share the same second, and the threshold setting may change while notification submission is in flight.

Every valid progress event increments `progressGeneration`. A protection candidate stores:

- Task display ID
- Last-progress timestamp
- Progress generation
- Threshold at the time

All four must still match when notification returns or grace expires. Any new progress or threshold change invalidates the old attempt.

### Protection Record Save Ordering

An attempt updates the in-memory record synchronously, then a task calls `ActivityProtectionStateStore.apply` in sequence. A disk-write failure is logged and does not prevent hiding the task.

Saved records restore protection during the next bootstrap. Hiding does not wait for disk commit, so recovery across restarts depends on the write succeeding.

### Reconciling Threshold Changes

Shortening the threshold immediately reevaluates running tasks already past it.

Lengthening it silently restores suppressed tasks that no longer exceed the new threshold and clears their records and notifications. Tasks still beyond the new threshold remain suppressed without duplicate alerts.

Turning off the sleep-prevention switch disables Activity Protection and restores all suppressed tasks in the current process.

## Protection-State Persistence

[`ActivityProtectionStateStore.swift`](../../../CodexBar/Services/Workflow/ActivityProtectionStateStore.swift) writes:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/CodexBar-yatotm/ActivityProtection/state.json
```

- Current schema is `1`
- Contains only hashed task identities and timestamps
- File permissions are `0600`
- Debug and Release share it through `flock`
- Records remain at most 24 hours after last progress

Task identity uses a SHA-256 digest; raw session and turn IDs never enter this state file. Anonymous tasks have no protection identity and never enter it.

### Constructing the Hashed Identity

Turn and session keys first become canonical strings with type prefixes and NUL separators, then SHA-256 is applied with the fixed domain separator `CodexBar.ActivityProtection.v1`.

Types and separators prevent boundary ambiguity between concatenated fields. The domain separator prevents directly correlating the same raw ID hashed for another use.

### Cross-Process State Merge

Both app bundle IDs can run together and observe the same Codex Hook data. With separate protection state, a stalled task hidden by one build might still drive sleep prevention in the other.

The state store uses an actor to serialize within one process and `flock` for cross-process read-modify-write. A removal can include `matchingMarkedAt`, preventing a late delete from an old process from removing a new record just written by another.

Writes sort by task identifier, atomically replace the file, and correct final permissions to `0600`.

## Generation and Old-Result Isolation

The monitor maintains generations for readers and asynchronous recovery:

- Discard late results from a replaced reader
- Publish no transition side effects before bootstrap completes
- A canceled drain does not satisfy a recovery barrier
- Explicitly unhealthy source state cannot reuse the last healthy snapshot for silence evaluation

These constraints prevent false completion alerts and incorrect release during system wake, Hook reinstall, or `CODEX_HOME` change.

### Main Generations in the Monitor

| Generation | Protected asynchronous path |
| --- | --- |
| `tailReaderGeneration` | Reader batch, rollout polling, and prompt backfill |
| `bootstrapCompletionGeneration` | Asynchronous lifecycle completion after repeated bootstrap attempts |
| `activityProtectionRecoveryGeneration` | Sleep, wake, and data-source recovery |
| Task `progressGeneration` | Protection candidate during notification grace |

Each answers a different “is this current?” question and cannot become one global counter. A task making progress without a reader change should invalidate only its protection attempt, not the entire reader.

## Suggested Failure-Scenario Tests

- Starting the app while a task is running shows it through bootstrap without replaying notifications
- Bootstrap retries while files continuously append and eventually obtains a stable boundary
- Three unstable attempts enter degraded state without starting silence evaluation
- A new prompt immediately replaces the old turn, and rollout terminal within 5 seconds classifies it correctly
- A `Stop` is not guessed when one session has several terminal candidates
- A missing reviewer enters waiting only after rollout confirms user
- Automatic review never emits a waiting transition
- The UI omits a falsely precise subagent count when association is unreliable
- Calling `drainNow()` during a read forces another new read
- Protection remains paused after a failed wake drain
- A silence candidate that progresses within the 3-second window is not hidden, and a late notification is withdrawn
- Lengthening the threshold restores suppressed tasks below the new threshold
- Concurrent Debug and Release updates do not let an old removal delete a new protection record
- Anonymous tasks never enter transitions, KeepAlive, or the protection state file
