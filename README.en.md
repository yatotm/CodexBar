CodexBar is a menu bar app for macOS 15 and later that brings your Codex account, rate limits, token usage, and live task status into one place.

It can notify you when a task finishes, needs approval, or when your rate limits change. It can also keep your Mac awake only while Codex tasks are running.

## Features

### Account and rate limits at a glance

- View your current Codex account and plan
- See every rate-limit window, its remaining allowance, and reset time
- Check available credits and banked resets
- Automatically use banked resets from 15 minutes to 6 hours before they expire, with a default lead time of 30 minutes; CodexBar can wake your Mac at the scheduled time and revalidate availability before use
- Show a selected rate-limit window directly beside the menu bar icon

### Understand your Codex usage

- Track total tokens, your highest daily usage, and usage streaks
- See your longest task duration
- Review 30 weeks of daily token usage in a heatmap
- Enable CodexBar Hook for daily session, turn, tool call, subagent, and other activity metrics

### Keep track of active tasks

- Menu bar status dots distinguish running tasks, tasks waiting for approval, and recently completed tasks
- The main panel shows the current task, project, model, reasoning effort, and elapsed time
- Task Center brings concurrent, recently completed, and recently terminated tasks together
- Receive alerts for completed tasks, approval requests, and stalled tasks

### Let long-running tasks finish

- Prevent system sleep only while eligible Codex tasks are active
- Optionally stay awake while waiting for approval or keep the display awake as well
- Set a keep-awake time limit, low-battery protection, and stalled task protection
- Restore normal system sleep automatically when tasks finish or a protection rule is triggered

### Fit naturally into macOS

- Runs as a menu bar app without taking up space in the Dock
- Supports a global keyboard shortcut, launch at login, and automatic updates
- Provides Simplified Chinese and English interfaces
- Configurable HTTP/HTTPS proxy for the Codex service
- Optionally merges daily Hook metrics across Macs through iCloud

## Installation

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask bob-zebedy/tap/codexbar
```

### DMG

- Live tasks and other Hook features require the running Codex version to be `0.145.0` or later
- Cross-device sync requires an available iCloud account on the Mac

## Privacy

Raw Hook events and live tasks are processed locally. Enabling cross-device sync uploads daily Hook aggregates to your private iCloud database. Account and usage data come through the local Codex app-server, which connects to the service; update checks use Sparkle.

See [Data, Sync, and Privacy](Docs/en/UserGuide/sync-data-privacy.md) for complete details about data access, local storage, and network boundaries.
